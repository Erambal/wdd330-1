                <em class="p">He</em> was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Messiah of the New. Under the direction of His
                Father, He was the creator of the earth. “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
                made that was made” (John 1:3). Though sinless, He was baptized to fulfill all righteousness. He “went
                about doing good” (Acts 10:38), yet was despised for it. His gospel was a message of 
                
                <em class="in_text">peace and goodwill.

                He entreated all to follow His example. He walked the roads of Palestine, healing the sick, causing the
                blind to see, and raising the dead. He taught the truths of eternity, the reality of our premortal
                existence, the purpose of our life on earth, and the potential for the sons and daughters of God in the
                life to come.<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">He</em> instituted the sacrament as a reminder of His great
                atoning sacrifice. He was arrested and condemned
                on spurious charges, convicted to satisfy a mob, and sentenced to die on Calvary’s cross. He gave His
                life to atone for the sins of all mankind. His was a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would
                ever live upon the earth.<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">We</em> solemnly testify that His life, which is central to all
                human history, neither began in Bethlehem nor
                concluded on Calvary. He was the Firstborn of the Father, the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the
                Redeemer of the world.<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">He</em> rose from the grave to “become the firstfruits of them
                that slept” (1 Cor. 15:20). As Risen Lord, He
                visited among those He had loved in life. He also ministered among His “other sheep” (John 10:16) in
                ancient America. In the modern world, He and His Father appeared to the boy Joseph Smith, ushering in
                the long-promised “dispensation of the fulness of times” (Eph. 1:10).

            <p class="text_2">
                <em class="p">Of</em> the Living Christ, the Prophet Joseph wrote: “His eyes
                were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head
                was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was
                as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: <br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">"I</em> am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he
                who was slain; I am your advocate with the
                Father” (D&C 110:3–4).<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">Of</em> Him the Prophet also declared: “And now, after the many
                testimonies which have been given of him,
                this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">"For</em> we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard
                the voice bearing record that he is the
                Only Begotten of the Father—<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">"That</em> by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are
                and were created, and the inhabitants thereof
                are begotten sons and daughters unto God” (D&C 76:22–24).<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">We</em> declare in words of solemnity that His priesthood and His
                Church have been restored upon the
                earth—“built upon the foundation of … apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner
                stone” (Eph. 2:20).<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">We</em> testify that He will someday return to earth. “And the
                glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all
                flesh shall see it together” (Isa. 40:5). He will rule as King of Kings and reign as Lord of Lords, and
                every knee shall bend and every tongue shall speak in worship before Him. Each of us will stand to be
                judged
                of Him according to our works and the desires of our hearts.<br>
                <br>
                <em class="p">We</em> bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles—that Jesus
                is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of
                God. He is the great King Immanuel, who stands today on the right hand of His Father. He is the light,
                the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and
                eternal
                life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son.
